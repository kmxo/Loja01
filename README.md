Clients: a page to show a list of clients;

Create a new Client: a form to create a new client.

### Exercises to practice the MVC pattern

* The challenge is to practice the MVC pattern without a database.
* Create a list of clients in order to see the result within Clients menu. It will be only a runtime (temporary) information but it does the job as our purpose here is to study the technology.

### Installing

* Clone the project and run it using Visual Studio 2022.
* No file modifications needed.
