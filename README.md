Clients: a page to show a list of clients;

Create a new Client: a form to create a new client.

### Exercises to practice the MVC pattern

* In this project we have a Model to represent a client. We have two Views and a Controller.
* The form within the view Client -> Create send data to the ClientController. The CreateClient Action simply add the information to a list of clients. The list of clients is displayed in the View Client -> Index. 
* Create others projects with different classes and fields until you get confortable implementing this pattern. 
* When you're able to implement this pattern without consulting this code, we're ready to study Entity Framework.

### Installing

* Clone the project and run it using Visual Studio 2022.
* No file modifications needed.
